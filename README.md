Dedicated to Ksyusha :)

Also, copy the link to the project to your friends, I will really appreciate it! 
Oh, one more thing, updates are not going to come out regularly due to lack of time.
You can suggest ideas for a language, I will try to make them. (I am a beginner, so I am not sure it will be done, but I'll try).

Thanks for your attention! ♡ ´･ᴗ･ `♡
